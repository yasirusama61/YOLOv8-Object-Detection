## Overview of Faster R-CNN 🖼️

Faster R-CNN is a state-of-the-art two-stage object detection framework designed for high accuracy in identifying objects within an image. Below is a detailed explanation of its architecture:

---

### 🔑 **Key Components**
- **Backbone**:
  - ResNet-50 with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is used for extracting rich, multi-scale features from input images.
- **RPN (Region Proposal Network)**:
  - Proposes candidate regions in the image that may contain objects.
- **RoI Pooling**:
  - Aligns features from the proposed regions into a uniform size for further processing.
- **Prediction Heads**:
  - **Classification Head**: Predicts the object categories within the proposed regions.
  - **Bounding Box Regressor**: Refines the coordinates of bounding boxes for better localization.

---

### 🛠️ **Workflow**
1. **Input Image Processing**:
   - The input image is fed into the backbone for feature extraction.
2. **Feature Extraction (FPN)**:
   - Multi-scale features are generated by the FPN for different levels of abstraction.
3. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**:
   - Generates candidate bounding boxes or "region proposals."
4. **RoI Pooling**:
   - Extracts fixed-size feature maps from each region proposal.
5. **Prediction**:
   - The extracted features are passed through fully connected layers to:
     - **Classify objects** within regions of interest.
     - **Refine bounding box coordinates** for better accuracy.

## 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **1. Class Distribution**
The dataset contains imbalanced classes, as shown in the chart below. This highlights the importance of oversampling, augmentation, or WeightedRandomSampler techniques to manage minority classes effectively.

### **2. Bounding Box Distribution**
Analyzing bounding box dimensions helps uncover patterns that can inform preprocessing and augmentation strategies. Below are the width, height, and area distributions of the bounding boxes in the dataset:

#### **Bounding Box Width Distribution**

#### **Bounding Box Height Distribution**

#### **Bounding Box Area Distribution**
![Bounding Box Area](results/visualizations/bounding_box_area.png)

---
### **Key Insights from EDA**

1. **Class Distribution**:
   - The dataset shows significant class imbalance, with **Consolidation** and **Effusion** being the most common categories, while **Mass** and **Pneumothorax** are underrepresented.
   - This imbalance highlights the need for techniques like **oversampling**, **augmentation**, or **WeightedRandomSampler** to address model bias.

2. **Bounding Box Width, Height, and Area**:
   - **Width and Height**:
     - Most bounding boxes are small, with the majority having widths and heights under 200 pixels.
   - **Area**:
     - Bounding box areas are heavily skewed towards smaller regions, indicating that small abnormalities dominate the dataset.
   - These patterns suggest that the model must handle **small object detection** effectively, which may require **attention mechanisms** (e.g., CBAM) or **multi-scale feature maps** (e.g., FPN).

By addressing these challenges during preprocessing and model design, performance on challenging classes and smaller abnormalities can be significantly improved.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Project**
### 1️. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasirusama61/YOLOv8-Object-Detection.git
cd thoracic-abnormality-detection
```
### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
## 🛠️ **Data Preparation**

### **Step 1: Convert Annotations to YOLO Format**  
📄 Use the following script to process `train.json` and `test.json`, converting them into YOLO-compatible annotations:

```bash
python scripts/convert_annotations.py
```
  This script:
  - Converts bounding box annotations to YOLO format (class_id x_center y_center width height).
  - Treats missing data (images without bounding boxes) as background by creating empty .txt files.

### **Step 2: Verify Dataset**
  Ensure the following structure:

  ```
  yolo_dataset/
  ├── images/
  │   ├── train/     # Training images
  │   ├── test/      # Testing images
  ├── labels/
  │   ├── train/     # YOLO format labels for training
  │   ├── test/      # YOLO format labels for testing
  ```
